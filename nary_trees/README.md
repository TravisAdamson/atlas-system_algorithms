# Learning Objectives

* At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General

* What is a N-ary tree
* What are the most common usage of N-ary trees
* How to represent an N-ary tree in C in at least two different ways
* What is the diameter of an N-ary tree

# Requirements

# General

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Your C programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 9.4.0 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are allowed to use the standard library
* In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called nary_trees.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded
